                <p>In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong
                    abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may
                    use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant
                    areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program
                    simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction
                    provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is.[1]

                    In the 1960s, a high-level programming language using a compiler was commonly called an autocode.[2]
                    Examples of autocodes are COBOL and Fortran.[3]</p>
                <p>The first high-level programming language designed for computers was Plankalkül, created by Konrad
                    Zuse.[4] However, it was not implemented in his time, and his original contributions were largely
                    isolated from other developments due to World War II, aside from the language's influence on the
                    "Superplan" language by Heinz Rutishauser and also to some degree ALGOL. The first significantly
                    widespread high-level language was Fortran, a machine-independent development of IBM's earlier
                    Autocode systems. The ALGOL family, with ALGOL 58 defined in 1958 and ALGOL 60 defined in 1960 by
                    committees of European and American computer scientists, introduced recursion as well as nested
                    functions under lexical scope. ALGOL 60 was also the first language with a clear distinction between
                    value and name-parameters and their corresponding semantics.[5] ALGOL also introduced several
                    structured programming concepts, such as the while-do and if-then-else constructs and its syntax was
                    the first to be described in formal notation – Backus–Naur form (BNF). During roughly the same
                    period, COBOL introduced records (also called structs) and Lisp introduced a fully general lambda
                    abstraction in a programming language for the first time.</p>

                <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology
                    of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the
                    client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
                    browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                    standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                    It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                    application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
                    standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                    graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs
                    for I/O.

                    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some
                    servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

                    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
                    languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
                <p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993.
                    Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent
                    World Wide Web.[12] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which
                    released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the
                    most-used.[13]

                    During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for
                    dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web
                    development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting
                    language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems
                    to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme
                    language.[6]

                    Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with
                    syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the
                    new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of
                    a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in
                    December.[6][1][14]

                    The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to
                    Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich
                    considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[15]></p>
                
                <code>

                <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
                    readability with the use of significant indentation.[31]

                    Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is
                    often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
                    library.[32][33]

                    Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming
                    language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[34] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python
                    3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier
                    versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[35]

                    Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained
                    widespread use in the machine learning community.[36][37][38][39]</p>
                <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s[40] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica
                    (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by
                    SETL,[41] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[10] Its
                    implementation began in December 1989.[42] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the
                    project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from
                    his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community
                    bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[43] In
                    January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the
                    project.[44][45]

                    Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list
                    comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[46]
                    Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python
                    2.6.x[47] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation
                    of Python 2 code to Python 3.[48]

                    Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a
                    large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[49][50] No further
                    security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[51][52] Currently only 3.8 and later
                    are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[53]).

                    In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were
                    insecure (including 2.7[54]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code
                    execution[55] and web-cache poisoning.[56] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[57] and
                    3.8.13, because of many security issues.[58] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was
                    announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security
                    fixes in the future.[59] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential
                    denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[60][61]

                    As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with
                    active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased
                    program execution speed and improved error reporting.[62]

                    Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the
                    language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new
                    type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft)
                    keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and
                    functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.

                    Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5%
                    on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.

                    Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security
                    support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[63]</p>

                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as
                    few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
                    to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on
                    all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically
                    compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
                    computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level
                    facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection
                    and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

                    Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language
                    since then.[18] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub[19]
                    and it is ranked fourth on TIOBE index as of October 2023.[20] Although still widely popular, there
                    has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining
                    popularity.[21]

                    Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a
                    core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java
                    compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary
                    licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun
                    had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own
                    HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which
                    is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux
                    distributions.

                    As of September 2023, Java 21 is the latest version, which is also a long-term support (LTS)
                    version. Java 8, 11, and 17 are previous LTS versions still officially supported.</p>
                <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June
                    1991.[22] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the
                    digital cable television industry at the time.[23] The language was initially called Oak after an
                    oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was
                    finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[24] Gosling designed Java
                    with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[25]

                    Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[26] It promised write
                    once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly
                    secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major
                    web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly
                    became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly
                    with the Java 1.0 language specification.[27] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE
                    1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of
                    platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server
                    environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was
                    renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and
                    Java SE, respectively.

                    In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma
                    International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[28][29][30] Java remains a
                    de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[31] At one time, Sun made most of
                    its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun
                    generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the
                    Java Enterprise System.

                    On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source
                    software (FOSS), under the terms of the GPL-2.0-only license. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the
                    process, making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution
                    terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.[32]

                    Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an
                    evangelist.[33] Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009–10, Oracle
                    has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a
                    community of participation and transparency.[34] This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit

                    In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue
                    the browser plugin.[36]

                    Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific
                    supercomputers.[37]

                    Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java, due to
                    unresolved security issues in older versions.[38]</p>

                <p>C++ (/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced "C plus plus" and sometimes abbreviated as CPP) is a high-level,
                    general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First
                    released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly
                    over time; as of 1997 C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to
                    facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled
                    language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM,
                    Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.[14]

                    C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large
                    systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[15]
                    C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software
                    infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[15] including desktop applications, video
                    games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications
                    (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[16]

                    C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
                    standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally
                    known as C++20).[17] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC
                    14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current
                    C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the
                    initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an
                    extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also
                    provided high-level features for program organization.[18] Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year
                    release schedule[19] with C++23 as the next planned standard.[20]</p>
                <p>In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the
                    predecessor to C++.[21] The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's
                    experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were
                    very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while
                    BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup
                    started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to
                    distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language
                    with Simula-like features.[22] C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and
                    widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new
                    language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.

                    Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes,
                    derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.[23]


                    A quiz on C++11 features being given in Paris in 2015
                    In 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named "C++" (++ being
                    the increment operator in C) after going through several other names. New features were added,
                    including virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants,
                    type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style
                    single-line comments with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new,
                    standalone compiler for C++, Cfront.

                    In 1984, Stroustrup implemented the first stream input/output library. The idea of providing an
                    output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy[2] (who had
                    previously suggested Unix pipes).

                    In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the definitive
                    reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.[24] The first commercial
                    implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.[21]

                    In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming
                    Language in 1991.[25] New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static
                    member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++
                    Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature
                    additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a Boolean type.

                    In 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update (C++03) was released in
                    2003.

                    After C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released, adding
                    numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++
                    programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were
                    introduced in C++17.[26] After becoming finalized in February 2020,[27] a draft of the C++20
                    standard was approved on 4 September 2020 and officially published on 15 December 2020.[28][29]

                    On January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize
                    for Engineering, "for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language".[30]

                    As of December 2022 C++ ranked third on the TIOBE index, surpassing Java for the first time in the
                    history of the index. It ranks 3rd, after Python and C.[31]

                    Etymology
                    According to Stroustrup, "the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C".[32]
                    This name is credited to Rick Mascitti (mid-1983)[23] and was first used in December 1983. When
                    Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he indicated that it was given in a
                    tongue-in-cheek spirit. The name comes from C's ++ operator (which increments the value of a
                    variable) and a common naming convention of using "+" to indicate an enhanced computer program.

                    During C++'s development period, the language had been referred to as "new C" and "C with
                    Classes"[23][33] before acquiring its final name.</p>
